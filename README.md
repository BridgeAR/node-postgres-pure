node-postgres-pure
==================

The exact same node-postgres module without any of the C/C++ stuff. If you're just using the pure JavaScript bindings, there's really no reason to wait for the native stuff to compile.

## DEPRECATED

node-postgres has been updated to make the native compilation and bindings an optional install. This module is no longer nessassary - it's literally the exact same code as node-postgres now, so you should go install that instead. :smile:
